This module allows users to add certain nodes to a favorite list.
Each node has an "add to favorites" link at the bottom.
This favorite list is visible to others viewing the site.

The admin can specify which type of nodes are allowed to be
added to favorites by users.

Views integration provide the following:
- Filter for current users (my favorite nodes)
- Filter for all nodes that have been added to favorites by any user.
- A field that shows how many users have added the node to favorites,
  useful as an indication for popularity.
- An argument that allows filtering of Favorites nodes for a specific user.
  This is useful to show "editor's picks" and such type of lists.
